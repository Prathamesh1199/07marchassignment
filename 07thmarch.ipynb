    "mean and median. The mean is particularly sensitive to outliers because it takes into account\n",
    "the value of every data point. A single outlier with an extreme value can shift the mean significantly,\n",

    "can be significantly affected by outliers. Similarly, the variance and standard deviation, which\n",
    "are measures of how much the data varies around the mean, can be influenced by outliers. Outliers\n",

    "of central tendency for this dataset. The range of the dataset is also affected by the outlier\n",
    "value, as it is 90, which is much larger than the typical spread of the data. The variance and\n",
    "standard deviation of the dataset are also larger due to the presence of the outlier value...\n",
